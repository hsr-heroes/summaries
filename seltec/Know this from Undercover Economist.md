Know this from Undercover Economist:

**Three factors that might destroy the "ideal model" of the free market**

1. Scarcity power  
Bargaining strength comes through scarcity.

2. Inside/missing information (needs, desires)  
Example: buying a good second-hand car. There's a trust issue because the seller wants to get the best price for his car so he doesn't tell you everything about the history of the car.

3. Externalities (side effects on bystanders)  
Example: pollution in city as a cause of heavy traffic. An externality charge would solve this (e.g. co2 taxes).

**Various methods used by companies to target customers**

1. Individual target Strategy  
** Evaluate each costumer as an individual and charge according to how much he is willing to pay  
** “Money on” voucher (Amazon let you pay more on special products)
** “Money off” voucher like discount cards (Supercard)
2. Group target strategy

** Discounts for groups like students or locals.  
By offering a discount for students you actually add a "premium" for working people who can afford it; plus students will come more often. Win-win situation.

1. Self-incrimination strategy  
Get customers to confess that they are not price sensitive, for example by binding a customer to a company. Example: Apple products.

**Why are poor countries poor?**

* The rot starts with the government but it afflicts the entire society. There’s no point investing in a business because the government will not protect you against thieves.  
Example: In African countries phone companies often do not offer contracts, instead you pay as you go.
* Doubts on the honesty of the dictator. He might put all the money in his own pocket.
* Corruption is widespread.

**What is "red tape"?**

Red tape is an idiom that refers to excessive regulation or rigid conformity to formal rules that is considered redundant or bureaucratic and hinders or prevents action or decision-making. It is usually applied to governments, corporations, and other large organizations.

Short: There's too much regulation, the bureaucratic process makes it difficult to start a business, etc.

**Know the history of Mao and Chinese economics**

Mao conducted economic policy on the hidden premise that if people tried hard, the impossible would happen.
People needed to "destroy knives to produce knives", which is ridiculous.

Central planning: decisions on what to produce, how to produce and for whom are taken by the government (communist economy).

Deng Xiaoping had begun to travel along the so-called capitalist road, slowly getting away (at least partially) from the communist economy by reducing central planning.

Agricultural reforms made farming far more lucrative. There was extreme economic growth thanks to the commitment to freeze the size of the plan. The plan was keep fixed which guaranteed a certain stability.

The market operated exactly where it needs to: at the margin.

There were many benefits from opening up its economy to the world:

* China could tap into world markets for labour-intensive goods, toys, shoes, clothes
* The foreign currency those exports earned could be spend on raw materials and on new technology to develop the economy
* By inviting foreign investors the Chinese could learn modern production and business techniques from them

**Two types of innovation mentioned in the [Tim Harford video](http://timharford.com/2013/01/how-to-support-innovations-that-matter/) (incremental improvements vs. long-shot solutions)**

Tim Harford first talks about marginal improvements, i.e. making things just a little bit better. His example: The 2012 summer Olympics in London.

Matt Parker came up with the idea for "hot pants" which cyclists would wear in order to keep their muscles warm. He also told cyclists to wash their hands to not get sick because they would get in contact with lots of people from all over the world. Cleaning tires with alcohol so they have more grip.

These are all small incremental improvements which helped pave the way to success.

Organizations often only focus on these marginal improvements because investors will get results for their money.

In contrast, bigger innovations are more riskier because you don't know if it pays out. His example: Mario Capecchi, a molecular biologist, who wanted to do something he was told was impossible. He didn't want to do marginal improvements, he wanted to really innovate. And he did, winning the Nobel Prize in 2007.

If you want the best innovations, you need to fund the long-shots. But again, it's not easy because it's risky and there will be lots of failures. Maybe you will never get the breakthrough.
